## Emotion-Based Music Recommendation Web App

This Flask-based web application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect emotions from a live webcam feed and recommends music based on the detected emotion. It also allows the user to choose their preferred language and singer to tailor the music recommendations.

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd emotion-based-music-recommendation
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. The home page will prompt you to choose your preferred language.

4. Once you've selected your preferred language, the next page will prompt you to choose a singer.

5. Click the "Start Emotion Detection" button to initiate emotion detection using your webcam.

6. The app will use the pre-trained model to detect your emotion and recommend music based on the detected emotion. A YouTube search link for the recommended music will be opened in your default web browser.

### Requirements

- Flask
- numpy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- keras
- webbrowser

### Model and Data

- The deep learning model is loaded from `model.h5`.
- The Haarcascade classifier XML file `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` is used for face detection.
- Label mapping is used to convert model predictions into human-readable emotions.
- Music recommendation links are generated using YouTube search queries based on the detected emotion and the chosen singer.

### Credits

- This application was developed by Ayamullah Khan.
- The deep learning model is based on [source link to the model].
- Haarcascade classifier for face detection is obtained from [source link to Haarcascade XML].
